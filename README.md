City Explorer

**Author**: Brandon Wolf
**Version**: 0.0.1 

## Overview
Our cilent just moved to the Seattle area. After travleing across the country, they realized how much they love to travel. The problem is, they had a tough time juggling a bunch of sites to keep track of weather, food and entertainment. They need us to create an App that takes in all this information for each area they want to travel too. 

## Getting Started
We will need a REST API call to a site LocationIQ. We will also need a few functions to be able to take in a user input and display a map, list of restraunts and some entertainment. 

## Architecture
REACT, Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS, HTML
